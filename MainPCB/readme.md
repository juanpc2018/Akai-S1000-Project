Dimensions: </br>

its a 4-Layer Board, </br>
but Layer 2-3, seem to be very large planes only for (+) & GND, Unconfirmed. </br>
most compenents are on Layer-1. </br>
most traces are on Layer-4, almost all have a Classic Horizontal Design. </br>

Scanning The Bottom Layer-4 on a Cheap scanner with RGB-LED + Monochromatic CCD </br>
Scanner moves Vertical, Scans Horizontal PCB traces flawless, </br>
but Vertical PCB traces are almost invisible, </br>
45Â° Traces are 25%-50% visible. </br>
probably PCB scanning requires a White Source + RGB CCD sensor "The opposite technology". </br>

Weird things: </br>
cutting the back traces to install more than 2MB memory. </br>
Headphone output pcb is on the Back of the Chasis, over the Regulators Heatsink, "front of the MainPCB."</br>
but MainPCB connector is on the Front of the case "back of the PCB." </br>
Very bad design. </br>

The linear Regulators +12/-12vdc on the Top Left of the MainPCB, </br>
seems to be an independent circuit, but some traces go somewhere, Voltage Drop & Current limited with Diodes. </br>

Analog Audio PCB i/o board is appart, connected with a 50-pin ribbon cable, and another 3-pin for +12/-12dc.</br>
