SCSI add-on card for S1000 has External 50pin Centronics and internal 50-pin option. </br>
External SCSI is Not required unless want to add an SCSI CD-ROM "Obsolete", </br>
or an external SCSI2SD v5 or similar that can load .iso CD-ROM images </br>

Default SCSI card was External Connector, No Internal connector, but times change. </br>
Information about those connectors is getting hard to find.. </br>
Found 2 manufacturers: </br>
Amphenol and TE </br>
Amphenol had different models, but most were designed for bracket mount,  </br>
but... the SCSI Ear Secure Holders are Not on the connector, but the Bracket. </br>
TE has the standard connector with Secure Ears in the connector it self, for chassis mount. </br>
The -480 model had Bracket included. </br>

SCSI2SD project & others designed for Amiga, Atari and Macintosh computers, </br>
works for S1000 to emulate a HardDrive or scsi CD-ROM. </br>
