The S1000 has a Floppy, most people replace with a Gotek,  </br>

Gotek has 2x available firmwares, FlashFloppy and HxC.  </br>

https://github.com/keirf/FlashFloppy </br>
https://hxc2001.com/store/ </br>

but Gotek only Reads floppy image files, </br>
and can store / emulate 999 floppy disks. </br>
as long as the USB memory allows. </br>

if want "the real floppy experience" </br>
there are USB1.1 Floppy drives from Teac / Panasonic, Dell, </br>
required to install WindowsXP AHCI or RAID drivers on a Clean Install system, </br>
without real 34-pin Floppy connector on the board, 
required since X58 boards >2010. </br>
Newer USB2.0 and USB3.0 Floopy drives require different driver, Not compatible with XP CD installer. </br>

In Theory USB1.1 floppy drive could be connected to Gotek USB port "Untested." </br> 
IF works, will create a floppy image inside a real floppy disk, </br>
Not Native individual files like a Real Floppy drive. </br>

some USB1.1 floppy drives are Better than others, </br>
see the video RAID Floppy: </br>

Kryoflux is a more advanced Hardware version of OmniFloppy or USB1.1 Floppy drives, </br>
USB2.0 to Real Floppy 34-pin adapter/converter. </br>

The Floppy drive in the Yamaha V50 is the worse ive seen, absolute crap. </br>
but this Alps looks very nice, </br>
havent done tests / shootout vs. others, </br>
except the "Plastic" USB1.1 Floppy drive. </br>
Panasonic CF-VFDU03U / Teac FD-05PUB "Matsushita Made in Malaysia 2007" 5V 500mA </br>
USB1.1 is limited to 12Mbps = 1.5MB/s best case scenario, real speed is much less. </br>
Floppy 3.5" in-theory has 500kbps = 0,0625 MB/s. </br>
