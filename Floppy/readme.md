The S1000 has a Floppy, most people replace with a Gotek,  </br>
Gotek has 2x available firmwares, FlashFloppy and HxC.  </br>

but Gotek only read floppy image files. </br>
and can store / emulate 999 floppy disks. </br>
as long as the USB memory allows. </br>

if you want "the real floppy experience" </br>
there are USB1.1 Floppy drives from Teac / Panasonic, Dell, </br>
required to install WindowsXP AHCI or RAID drivers on a Clean Install system, </br>
without real Floppy connector in the board, like X58 boards. </br>

In Theory USB1.1 floppy drive could be connected to the Gotek USB port "Untested." </br> 
Newer USB2.0 and USB3.0 Floopy drives require different driver, Not compatible with XP CD installer. </br>
IF works, will create a floppy image, Not Native like the Real Floppy drive. </br>

some USB1.1 floppy drives are Better than others, see the video: RAID Floppy. </br>
