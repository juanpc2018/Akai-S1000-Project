NEC uPD70216GF-8 also known as:</br>
NEC V50 </br>
1984 </br>

V20 was a popular speed upgrade for 8088 XT machines. </br>

V50 is pin compatible, code compatible with 80186 "x86 on Steroids" Lawsuit included. </br>
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEC_V20 </br>

V20 is a faster 8-Bit 8088 </br> 
V30 is a 16-Bit 8086 with more instructions = 80186, pre-80286 era. </br>
V50 is a version of the v30, different package. </br>
"Embedded V30" Runs at 8MHz, but connected to a 16MHz XO, internally divided. </br>
V60 is completely different architecture "after lawsuit" </br>

since V50 Nor 80186 are No longer made, and V50 is Surface mount package, </br>
Not like V20 that was through hole DIP </br>
to keep the S-1000 alive, </br>
requires a CPU replacement, pin & opcode compatible, </br>
there are several options. </br>

Option: </br>
A) Intel Edison an x86 Atom CPU 386-Pentium, dual core, 500MHz, 1GB Ram, </br>
but pins are incompatible. </br>
B) Mame CPU emulator or similar, for making a "Virtual S-1000",</br>
Virtual S-1000 could be used to test modifications, similar to Commander X16. </br>
but the goal is to make a Real S-1000. </br>
in theory [PCem](https://www.pcem-emulator.co.uk/), and [86box](http://86box.net/2022/11/26/86box-v3-11.html) can also be used to make a Virtual S-1000 </br>
 
C) Altera Terasic DE10nano or better FPGA with 80186 core, Cyclone III/IV </br> 
FPGA can be pin compatible with V50, </br>
but Emulation always has a layer of uncertainty, </br>
Emulator Timings may Not be clock perfect, like the real V50,</br> 
instructions can have Bugs, etc...</br> but all that can be solved in time</br>
Out-of-the-Box, Edison could be a better replacement, </br>
but Edison is "Abandonware" and FPGA still rocks.</br>

Seems Akai S-1000 is based on a modified XT/286 board, with Apple inspired Nubus type connectors </br>
dedicated Only for Audio, that Runs entirely on the Bios. </br>
